This is the initial setup for my Flex Project for the Odin Project Web Development course.

Set up the git repository, then cloned it to local desktop.

Created the README.md, index.html, and style.css files.

This project is meant to test and work on my Flex skills in CSS. Learning how to position objects on the page using flexbox.
